# Personal dot files.

Managed using [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

Still work in progress, both from standpoint of adding all the config
that I have, tweaking these configuration files to work both on MacOS and
Linux and migrating from [old dotconfig](https://github.com/delicb/dotfiles-old).
